# VisRec API JSR381 implementation using DJL

The repository contains the source code of the reference implementation of JSR 381, 
a standardization in Java for Visual Recognition.

The Visual Recognition API JSR #381 is a software development standard recognized by the Java
Community Process (JCP) that simplifies and standardizes a set of APIs familiar to Java developers
for classifying and recognizing objects in images using machine learning. Beside classes specific
for visual recognition tasks, it provides general abstractions for machine learning tasks like
classification, regression and data set, and reusable design which can be applied for machine
learning systems in other domains. At the current stage it provides basic hello world examples
for supported machine learning tasks (classification and regression) and image classification.

This reference implementation is based on Deep Java Library (DJL) available at
